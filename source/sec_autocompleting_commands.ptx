  <title>Autocompleting Commands</title>
  <p>
    For convenience, Maple can automatically fill in the command that you wish to type.
    To do this, type in the first few letters of the command and then hit ESC.

      Ctrl+Space is another shortcut for this feature,
      if you find it more convenient while typing.

    For example,
    typing in <c>exp</c> and hitting ESC will provide the following list of commands.

  </figure>
  <p>
    From here, you can select the <c>exp</c> command for the exponential function,
    or possibly the <c>expand</c> command,
    which we will look at later.
    If the command requires a parameter,
    it should already be highlighted so that you can type in its value.
    If a command has multiple parameters,
    you can hit the Tab key to highlight the next parameter.
