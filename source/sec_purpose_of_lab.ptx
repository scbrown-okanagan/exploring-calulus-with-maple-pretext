  <p>
    Your lab section is designed to supplement the content that you are learning in lecture.
    You will be applying those lecture topics during the lab through Maple,
    which is a powerful computational software.
    It is the goal of the lab to aid in your understanding of calculus as well as introduce you to the tools of mathematics that are available through computers.
