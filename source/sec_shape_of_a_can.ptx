      Your goal in this question is to design the most economical shape of a perfectly cylindrical can.

      First, let us assume the can has to hold a volume of 250 mL (250<nbsp/>cm<m>^3</m>).
      The cylindrical sides as well as the top and bottom circles are cut from sheets of aluminum.
      The material for the cylindrical sides of the cans is made from rectangles that are bent,
      so no material is wasted.
      However, some amount of material is always wasted when trying to cut circles from a sheet of metal.
      To make the most economical can,
      your goal is to reduce the <em>total</em>
      amount of material needed,
      including any wasted metal.

    </figure>
    <p>
      If the circles are cut according to <xref ref="fig_square">Figure</xref>,
      then the total amount of material required for each can is a rectangle and two squares,
      which wastes a lot of material.
      If we plan to minimize the amount of material required,
      we will instead cut out circles according to <xref ref="fig_hexagon">Figure</xref>.
      The total area of material required for each can then becomes a rectangle and two hexagons.
