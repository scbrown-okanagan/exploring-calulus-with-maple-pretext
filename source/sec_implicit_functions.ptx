    <title>Introduction:</title>
    <p>
      In this activity, we will learn how to plot implicit functions,
      as well as compute their derivatives.
    </p>
    <aside>
      <p>
        There are a few important things to remember about the <c>implicitplot()</c> command during this activity:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              The <c>plots</c> package needs to be loaded using the <c>with()</c> command.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Some versions of Maple may not produce a smooth plot.
              In this case,
              include either <c>numpoints=30000</c> or <c>grid=[250,250]</c> as a parameter.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The optional <c>scaling=constrained</c> parameter can be included to enforce <m>1:1</m> scaling.
              Alternatively,
              the optional scaling can be performed by clicking on the graph and then clicking on the <m>1:1</m> button in the plot toolbar at the top of the page.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If you are plotting multiple graphs on the same set of axes,
              it is a good idea to specify plot colours.

                    try using the <c>solve()</c> command first,

                    To solve part (d),
                    you need to remember that the slope is zero when the tangent line is horizontal.
            <idx><h>lines</h><h>horizontal tangent line</h></idx>
        The equation <m>\frac{dy}{dx} = 0</m> and the equation of the curve itself form a system of equations that can be solved by Maple to give the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> value of each point.
                    An example of solving a system of equations can be found on <xref ref="sec_solvingsystemeqs">page</xref>.
