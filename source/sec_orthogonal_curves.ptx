    <title>Introduction:</title>
    <p>
      Orthogonal curves are curves that are perpendicular whenever they intersect.
      Perpendicular lines<idx><h>lines</h><h>perpendicular lines</h></idx> are an elementary example of this.
      We know that if <m>m_1</m> and <m>m_2</m> are the slopes of two perpendicular lines,
      then <m>m_1 m_2 = -1</m>.
      Similarly, two curves are orthogonal if their derivatives multiply to <m>-1</m> whenever they intersect.

        There are a few important things to remember about the <c>implicitplot()</c> command during this activity:<idx><h>implicit functions</h><h>implicitplot</h></idx>

          <li>

              The <c>plots</c> package needs to be loaded using the <c>with()</c> command.

              Some versions of Maple may not produce a smooth plot.
              In this case,
              include either <c>numpoints=30000</c> or <c>grid=[250,250]</c> as a parameter.

              The optional <c>scaling=constrained</c><idx><h>implicit functions</h><h>implicitplot!scaling</h></idx> parameter can be included to enforce <m>1:1</m> scaling.
              Alternatively,
              the optional scaling can be performed by clicking on the graph and then clicking on the <m>1:1</m> button in the plot toolbar at the top of the page.

              If you are plotting multiple graphs on the same set of axes,
              it is a good idea to specify plot colours.

                    In order to find points of intersection, Maple can solve a system of equations in one <c>solve()</c> <idx><h>solving equations</h><h>solve</h></idx> or <c>fsolve()</c><idx><h>solving equations</h><h>fsolve</h></idx> command for both <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
                    If you choose to use the <c>solve()</c> command,
                    you may need to include the optional parameter <c>explicit=true</c> to avoid the
                    <em>RootOf()</em> output.

                Are these curves orthogonal at the points of intersection?
                Confirm this using the fact that

                    It is a good idea to use the assignment operator <m>:=</m> to assign each derivative in part (c) to a name.
                    This will allow you to easily reference the derivatives when completing part (d).
