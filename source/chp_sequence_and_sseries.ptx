  <title>Sequences and Series</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Suppose we want to generate a list of integers that are <m>2</m> more than a multiple of <m>3</m>.
      For example,
      <m>32</m> is one of these numbers because <m>32 = 3(10)+2</m>.
      In other words,
      we want to create a list of numbers of the form <m>3k+2</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
          <idx><h>sequences and series</h></idx>
    </p>
    <p>
      Or perhaps we want a nice way to express and generate all the odd numbers <m>1,3,5,7,9,\ldots</m>
      (numbers of the form <m>2k+1</m>).
    </p>
    <p>
      These lists are called <em>sequences</em>.
      In both of these examples, <m>k</m> is known as an <em>index</em>.
