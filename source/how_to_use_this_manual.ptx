  <title>How to Use This Manual</title>
  <p>
    This book is divided into two main parts:
  </p>
  <p>
    <em><xref ref="pt_Activities">Part</xref></em>
    consists of activities for you to complete.
    These activities are divided into two chapters: Math 112 and Math 122.
    Each activity focuses on one topic from that course and contains a list of exercises for you to complete with Maple.
    Some of these exercises may give very explicit instructions for typing a command into Maple,
    while others may require you to use your own intuition and understanding of the capabilities of Maple.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em><xref ref="pt_Tutorials">Part</xref></em>
    consists of several chapters that provide examples of the usage of common commands in Maple.
    Many of these examples are designed to be minimalistic in order to show you their basic usage.
    Each of these examples was completed within Maple and should be reproducible on your own computer.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the beginning of each activity,
    a list of the most relevant tutorials is given.
    It is expected that you read through those tutorials as you complete the exercises of that activity.
    Many activities build upon previously learned commands,
    so it is a good idea to thoroughly read through all of the relevant tutorials as you progress through lab.
