    <title>Prior to lab</title>
    <p>
      Before lab, read through the activity as well as the recommended tutorials from the back of the book.
      Once you have read through the instructions and tutorials,
      you will need to complete the <em>reading quiz</em> for the activity.
    </p>
    <aside>
      <p>
        Some lab computers take a couple minutes to log into.
        Always give yourself a few extra minutes at the start of lab to log in.

    <title>Start of lab</title>
    <p>
      After logging into the school computer,
      you should begin by opening up the latest version of Maple as well your lab section's Moodle page.
      You are expected to have this lab manual with you during lab and you should complete all exercises in order.
      It is a great idea to have a pen or pencil handy to take notes in your manual while you complete the exercises.
      Your lab instructor will be available to assist you with the activity,
      though you will find that many of your questions can be answered by looking through the tutorial sections at the back of this book.
    </p>
    <aside>
      <p>
        Always bring your lab manual along to your lab.
        Take lots of notes in it!

    <title>End of lab</title>
    <p>
      Once you have completed the exercises,
      make sure to save your work!
      You are now ready to complete the <em>activity quiz</em>.
      The questions in this quiz should be relatively quick to answer once you have completed the exercises from the activity.
      Often, you can simply copy and paste the output from Maple into the blanks on the quiz.
      You will be required to <em>submit your Maple work</em> in addition to the quiz.
    </p>
    <aside>
      <p>
        The questions on your Moodle quiz relate to the exercises in this book.
        Make sure to finish your exercises prior to the quiz.

    <title>Final lab</title>
    <p>
      During your final lab,
      you will be expected to complete an open-book <em>lab test</em>.
      The test will be based upon the activities that you have completed throughout the semester.
      You are permitted to have this manual during the test.
