  <title>Accessing Maple and Saving Your Work</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Maple is installed on all lab computers as well as on computers in the library.
      However, personal copies of Maple are not available through Okanagan College at this time.

      On some Windows computers,
      the most recent version of Maple may be installed directly.
      In this case,
      you can simply hit the Start Menu key on your keyboard
      (in the lower left corner)
      and begin typing the word "Maple". If Maple is installed directly,
      then Windows Search will automatically find the version installed and display a link to the application.
      Alternatively,
      you should be able to find Maple by browsing the list of installed programs on the Start Menu.
    </p>
    <p>
      On other computers,
      you may need to log into a virtual machine to access Maple remotely.
      On these machines,
      you will typically find a link to VMware Horizon Client on the desktop.
      You will need to open this client and log into the remote machine using the same information as you previously used to log into the computer.
      Once the remote machine loads,
      you should find Maple in the Start Menu as described above.

    <title>Organizing Files in your Network Folder</title>

      You are given your own personal folder on the network in which to save your files.
      This folder is accessible from any computer on campus and from VMware Horizon,
      so you should save all of your work in this folder.
      You can find this folder by using the desktop shortcut or by opening up File Explorer and clicking on This PC.
    </p>

      It is best to create a new subfolder in your network folder for your lab.
      This folder could be called something like "Math 112 Labs" so that it is easy to find and organize all of your saved Maple files.
      When you wish to save your file in Maple,
      now you can navigate to this folder and save your file with the name of the activity.
    </p>

      The files that Maple saves are only readable through Maple.
      However, you can find the Export As tool under the File menu.
      From there, you can change the file type to PDF and save your document.
      PDF files can be read by other programs,
      but cannot be edited by Maple.

      <caption>You can export your Maple worksheet as a PDF file type, which can be opened on most devices without Maple. However, Maple cannot edit PDF files.</caption>

      The files that you have saved on your network folder on campus can be accessed from home through a browser by using the following address:
