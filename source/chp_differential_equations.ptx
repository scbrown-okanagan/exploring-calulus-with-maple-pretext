  <title>Differential Equations</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      We want to find solutions
      (and potentially graph said solutions)
      of <em>differential equations</em>
      <mdash/> equations that contain functions and derivatives of these functions.
      For the sake of ease, we will look at
      <em>first-order differential equations</em>:
      differential equations that only contain the
      <em>first</em> derivative
      (no higher-order derivatives).
