    <title>Introduction:</title>
    <p>
      In this activity,
      you will use direction fields to predict the population dynamics for a population of rabbits.
      Suppose that you have a population of rabbits and <m>P(t)</m> is the number of rabbits at time <m>t</m>.
    </p>
    <aside>
      <p>
        You will need to include the <c>DETools</c> package to use the <c>DEplot()</c> command.
      </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      We can model the population of rabbits using a basic model
      <men xml:id="eq_rabbits_basic">
        \frac{dP}{dt}=\alpha P - \beta P
      </men>,
      where <m>\alpha</m> is the birth rate and <m>\beta</m> is the death rate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Equation <xref ref="eq_rabbits_basic"/> does not consider limitations due to habitat and food supply.
      If we wish to use a more accurate model,
      then we can consider the logistic growth model
      <men xml:id="eq_rabbits_logistic">
        \frac{dP}{dt}= kP \left(1-\frac{P}{M}\right)
      </men>,
      where <m>k</m> is the relative growth rate and <m>M</m> is the carrying capacity
      (the maximum population that is sustainable).
    </p>
    <p>
      The death rate of the rabbits
      (due to hunting)
      can be added to this logistic model to obtain the differential equation
      <men xml:id="eq_rabbits_logistic_hunted">
        \frac{dP}{dt}=kP \left(1-\frac{P}{M}\right)-bP
      </men>,
      where <m>b</m> is the hunting rate.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will examine solutions to equations <xref ref="eq_rabbits_basic"/><ndash/><xref ref="eq_rabbits_logistic_hunted"/> using two different initial conditions:
      <m>P(0)=1</m> and <m>P(0)=50</m>.

      Most mammal population growth is dependent upon other species in the region,
      via an interconnected food web.
      One simple predator-prey model is the Lotka-Volterra model
      <md>
        <mrow xml:id="eq_rabbits_lotka_volterra" number="yes">\frac{dx}{dt} \amp = \alpha x-\beta xy</mrow>
        <mrow>\frac{dy}{dt} \amp = \gamma xy-\delta y,\nonumber</mrow>

        Make sure you insert multiplication between <m>x(t)</m> and <m>y(t)</m> here,
        otherwise Maple will think you want to use a variable called <m>xy</m>.
      </p>
    </aside>
    <p>
      where <m>x(t)</m> is the population of prey and <m>y(t)</m> is the population of predators.
      In this equation, the prey grow and are eaten by predators.
      The predators' growth depends on eating the prey and the predators have a death rate.

          Consider the Lotka-Volterra model in equation <xref ref="eq_rabbits_lotka_volterra"/>.

              Go to Tools, Tutors, Differential Equations, DE Plots,
              select Lotka-Volterra Model, and then DEPlot.
              If you want,
              you can change the parameters or the initial conditions.
              Then click quit to plot it on your Maple worksheet.

              In a new paragraph,
              explain what the prey and predator populations do on this direction field.
              Notice that the prey is on the <m>x</m>-axis and the predator is on the <m>y</m>-axis of the direction field.
