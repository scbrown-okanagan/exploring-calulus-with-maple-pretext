    For more information on any of these or other commands
    (for example, the
    <q>sin</q>
    command),
    you can type a question mark followed by the command name: \begin{mapleinput} {?sin} \end{mapleinput} A help menu will open,
    which describes the required parameters in the order they must be listed,
    as well as a few examples.
    These examples can be very useful for more complicated procedures.
    There may also be several options described for you to customize the procedure.

  <p>
    If you are unsure of the command name for a procedure that you think Maple should have built in,
    you can also search Maple help.
    For example, \begin{mapleinput} {?gcd} \end{mapleinput} will give a description of commands for finding the greatest common divisor and lowest common multiple of two values.
