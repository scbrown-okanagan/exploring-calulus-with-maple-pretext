  <title>Two Types of Solvers</title>
  <p>
    We will make use of two different equations solvers in Maple:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        <c>solve()</c>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            This solver attempts to solve an equation and then display the solutions in their exact form.
            <aside>
              <p>
                Maple will give complex solutions using {I = sqrt(-1)}{<m>\displaystyle I= \sqrt{-1}</m>}. For most of the exercises in the activities,
                these solutions can be ignored.
              </p>
            </aside>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            This solver will give both real and complex solutions.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Solutions to high-degree polynomials can be very large and may be displayed symbolically using
            <q><em>RootOf</em></q>
            placeholders.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <c>fsolve()</c>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              This solver uses numerical approximation methods and displays the solutions in decimal form.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              This solver will give real solutions with the number of digits assigned to <c>Digits</c>.
              <aside>
                <p>
                  It is a good idea to see the output of both solvers to decide which output is more useful.
                  A good strategy is to use <c>solve()</c> and see if the output is helpful.
                  If it is not,
                  then type an <c>f</c> at the start of that input and rerun the new command.
                </p>
              </aside>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Some solutions may not be found by the methods used by the solver.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
