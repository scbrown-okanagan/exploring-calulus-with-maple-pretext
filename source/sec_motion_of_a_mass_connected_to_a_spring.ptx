      According to Hooke's law (<m>F=-kx</m>) and Newton's second law (<m>F=ma</m>),
      the differential equation for the motion of a mass (<m>m</m>) on the end of a spring is
      <me>
        m \frac{d^2x}{dt^2}=-kx
      </me>,
    </p>
    <p>
          <idx><h>differential equations</h><h>hooke's law</h></idx>
      where <m>k</m> is the spring constant (a measure of the stiffness of the spring).
      This equation assumes no damping
      (resistance).
      The displacement of the mass from equilibrium is denoted by <m>x</m>,
      and thus <m>\frac{dx}{dt}</m> is the velocity,
      and <m>\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}</m> is the acceleration.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we add damping (resistance) to the spring,
      then the damping is opposite the direction of the motion and proportional to the velocity.
      Therefore we have the equation,
      <me>
        m \frac{d^2x}{dt^2}=-kx-c\frac{dx}{dt}
      </me>,
      where <m>c</m> is the damping constant.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the exercises,
      we will assume that the mass is <m>m=2</m>-kg and the spring constant is <m>k=3</m> kg/s<m>^2</m>.
      We will look at the equation of motion with no damping (<m>c=0</m>),
      overdamping (<m>c=4</m> kg/s), and underdamping
      (<m>c=0.5</m> kg/s).
    </p>
    <p>
      In all cases,
      we will use the initial conditions <m>x(0)=1</m> m and <m>x'(0)=-1</m> m/s.

            To solve these differential equations algebraically you assume that solutions are of the form
            <m>x(t)={ e}^{rt}</m> and then plug it into the differential equation to get the
            <q>characteristic equation</q>
            to solve for <m>r</m>.
            If the roots are complex, you will have oscillations
            (sine and cosine functions)
            and if the roots are real, then you have strictly exponential solutions.
            Notice that the overdamped case has no oscillations whereas the underdamping and no-damping cases have oscillations in their solutions.
