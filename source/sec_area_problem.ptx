    <title>Introduction:</title>
    <p>
      Consider two functions, <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m>.
      We can find the <em>total</em> area between these two curves,
      over an interval <m>a \le x \le b</m>,
      by integrating the absolute value of the difference between these two functions.
      In other words,
      <me>
        \text{ Total Area }  = \displaystyle\int_a^b \abs{f(x)-g(x)}\,dx
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
          <idx><h>integral</h><h>total area</h></idx>
      If <m>f(x) \ge g(x)</m> over that interval, then the absolute value can be dropped.
      If <m>g(x) \ge f(x)</m> over that interval,
      then the absolute value can be dropped and the order of subtraction reversed.
    </p>
    <aside>
      <p>
        If <m>f(x)\ge g(x)</m> for some subintervals of <m>a \le x \le b</m> and
        <m>g(x) \ge f(x)</m> for other subintervals of <m>a \le x \le b</m>,
        then the intersection points of the two functions must be found and the integral must be split into multiple parts for each subinterval.
        Maple handles this process automatically.
      </p>
    </aside>
    <p>
      In other circumstances, we may be interested in the <em>net</em>
      area between <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m>.
      For example,
      if <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m> both represent rates of change of some quantity,
      then the net area
      <me>
        \text{ Net Area }  = \displaystyle\int_a^b \left(f(x)-g(x)\right)\,dx
      </me>
      will give us the net difference between the two quantities over an interval.

          In this exercise,
          we will find the area of the region bounded by the curves
          <me>
            y = x^2 - c^2 \;\; \text{ and }  \;\; y = c^2 - x^2
          </me>
          and ultimately,
          determine the value of <m>c</m> that gives an exact area of 576.

              Maple will not be able to plot these two curves on the <m>xy</m>-plane,
              since there is an unexpected third variable, <m>c</m>.
              You will need to choose a value of <m>c</m> to see an example.

              To begin, we should view the region between the two curves.
              Repeat the following steps for at least two different choices of <m>c</m>.

                  Plot <m>y = x^2 - c^2</m> and
                  <m>y=c^2 - x^2</m> on the same axes using your choice of <m>c</m>.

                  Adjust the axes so that you can view the entire region.

                  Once the entire region is shown on your plot,
                  estimate the <m>x</m>-coordinates of the two points of intersection.

            Since velocity is a rate of change of position,
            integrating velocity over an interval of time gives the net change in position,
            called displacement.
            Integrating the difference of two velocity functions gives the net difference between the two displacements.
