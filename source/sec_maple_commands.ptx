  <title>Maple Commands</title>
  <p>
    If we wish to do anything more complicated than basic arithmetic in Maple,
    we likely need to use a special <em>command</em>
    to perform the desired task.
    Commands have two parts:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          the <em>command name</em>:
          this is usually one or more words with no spaces that describes what the command does.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          the <em>parameters</em> of the command:
          these are the objects that the command needs to be given so that it can complete its procedure.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    The syntax of a command is as follows:
  </p>
  <aside>
    <p>
      Never include a space between the name of the command and the parentheses around the parameters.
      Maple will erroneously treat this space as multiplication.
    </p>
  </aside>
  <p>
     <c>command( parameter1, parameter2, ... )</c> You should note that the parameters are always enclosed in parentheses <c>( )</c> and there is no space between the name of the command and the first parenthesis.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some commands only need one parameter,
    while others need multiple parameters.
    In many cases, additional,
    optional parameters can be added to perform a more specialized procedure.
