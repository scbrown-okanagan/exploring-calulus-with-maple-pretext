  <title>The Maple Computer Algebra System</title>
  <p>
    In lab, you will be using the latest version of Maple,
    which is a symbolic and numeric computing environment.
    Maple provides an interface for analyzing,
    exploring, visualizing, and solving mathematical problems.
    The interface also allows you to maintain an easy-to-follow document so that you can retrace your thought process.
    If you plan to pursue any branch of mathematics or field that relies on mathematics,
    having basic knowledge of a computer algebra system is a very useful tool.
